(This is the most charitable, quick version of things I did for money [work])

I am a Colorado native and a Denver Broncos fan who also bleeds CU Black and Gold. I grew up in the Ft. Collins area, went to school in Boulder, spent my college weekends on the slopes in Summit County, and now drag my family across the state looking for anything interesting or fun along the way. My one unColorado flaw is a love for the beach and an inexplicable desire to own a yacht.
